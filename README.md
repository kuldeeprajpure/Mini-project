# tour booking management </br>
The Tourism Management System is implemented by C programming. It is as same as one can see while going for online booking. Here, the underlying idea is to present users with two choices International or India Tour packages. Then according to the choice, the available packages will be displayed. The next step is to mention the total number of passengers and all the necessary details of the passengers. The total amount will be evaluated and a receipt will be generated on the screen.
